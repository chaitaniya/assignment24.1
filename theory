Problem Statement
Explain with an example in brief. 


Hive Data Definitions


Hive Data Definition commands are used to perform basic database operations. Some DDL commands are-
1.	CREATE DATABASE- This command is used to create a database. The simplest syntax for creating a database is shown below
 CREATE DATABASE custom; 
Hive will throw an error if financials already exists. You can suppress these warnings with this variation: 
 CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS custom;
2.	DESCRIBE DATABASE – Describe command describes the database. It shows the location of database.
DESCRIBE DATABASE custom;
3.	 USE DATABASE- The USE command sets a database as your working database, analogous to changing working directories in a filesystem. 
USE custom;
4.	DROP DATABASE- This command is used to delete the database. Cascade keyword is used to drop he tables as well from the database.
DROP DATABASE custom CASCADE;

5.	CREATE TABLE- It is used to create a table in database. Complete schema is defined while giving the syntax. 
CREATE TABLE IF EXISTS emp_details
(emp_name string, unit string, exp int, location string ) row format delimited fields terminated by ',’; 
6.	 DROP TABLE- It is used to delete table.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS emp_details;
7.  
Alter Table Statement
It is used to alter a table in Hive.
The statement takes any of the following syntaxes based on what attributes we wish to modify in a table.
ALTER TABLE name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER TABLE name ADD COLUMNS (col_spec[, col_spec ...])


Hive Data Manipulations 
 
 
1.	LOAD DATA- Load operations are currently pure copy/move operations that move data files into locations corresponding to Hive tables. 
 LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INPATH 'filepath' [OVERWRITE] INTO TABLE tablename [PARTITION (partcol1=val1, partcol2=val2 ...)] •
-	file path can refer to a file (in which case Hive will move the file into the table) or it can be a directory (in which case Hive will move all the files within that directory into the table). 
-	 If the keyword LOCAL is specified, then: 
-	the load command will look for filepath in the local file system. 
-	 If a relative path is specified, it will be interpreted relative to the user's current working directory. 
-	 The user can specify a full URI for local files as well, for example: file:///user/hive/project/data1 
-	 the load command will try to copy all the files addressed by filepath to the target filesystem.
-	INSERT OVERWRITE [LOCAL] DIRECTORY directory1 [ROW FORMAT row_format] [STORED AS file_format] (Note: Only available starting with Hive 0.11.0) SELECT ... FROM ...


HiveQL Manipulations-


The Hive Query Language (HiveQL) is a query language for Hive to process and analyze structured data in a Metastore.
1.	SELECT- SELECT statement is used to retrieve the data from a table. 
SELECT * FROM emp_details;
This statement will give all the data stored in table. Some clauses are used with SELECT statement to select data based on some condition.
a.	WHERE- WHERE clause works similar to a condition. It filters the data using the condition and gives you a finite result.
b.	ORDER BY- ORDER BY clause is used to retrieve the details based on one column and sort the result set by ascending or descending order.
c.	GROUP BY- GROUP BY clause is used to group all the records in a result set using a particular collection column. It is used to query a group of records.
